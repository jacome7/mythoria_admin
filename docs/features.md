# Features (legacy pointer)

Detailed feature documentation now lives under `docs/features/`, with one markdown file per major page domain under `src/app`.

Each document includes:

- Context and purpose
- UI workflow and operator journey
- Backend/API touchpoints
- Database structure involved in the feature

Start with:

- `docs/features/dashboard.md`
- `docs/features/usersManagement.md`
- `docs/features/storiesManagement.md`
- `docs/features/ticketsManagement.md`
