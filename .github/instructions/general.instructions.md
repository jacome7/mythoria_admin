## Charts and Data Visualization

Use **Recharts** library for all charts and data visualizations in the admin portal.

Best practices when using Recharts:
- Always wrap charts in `ResponsiveContainer` for proper sizing and responsiveness
- Define explicit TypeScript types for all chart data structures
- Use client components (`"use client"` directive) when rendering charts
- Available chart types: AreaChart, BarChart, LineChart, ComposedChart, PieChart, RadarChart, RadialBarChart, ScatterChart, FunnelChart, Treemap, and Sankey
- Common components: ResponsiveContainer, Legend, Tooltip, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid
- Make components reusable by accepting typed props for data, axis keys, and styling
- Handle asynchronous data fetching properly with loading states
- Customize tooltips and legends to match DaisyUI theme colors
